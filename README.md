## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

Mike  
Eye for detail, good at researching things.  

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?  
Mike- for troubleshooting ||| Kati- Perserverance in initial coding.  

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?  
Kati- understanding of how the front end, back end, and DB work together. ||| Mike- Styling the page.  

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?  
Communicate what we're doing/which trello feature we're doing.  Tried to divide work evenly.  

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?  
Talk to them, try not to do too much or too little.  

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?  
Talk to them, try not to do too much or too little.  

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Make a lot of notes in the code.  Ask questions.
